In this lab, we are discussing margin of error: what it means, different ways to interpret it, and what variables have an impact on it.
\end{abstract}
\noindent \textbf{Keywords:} Sample size, margin of error, polling, resampling.
\section{Introduction}
In this lab, we are going to test some of Gallup's claims, including the one about the margin of error halving if we increase sample size from 1000 to 2000. To do this we will have to assume the population proportion.

We can also gather information without making an assumption about the population proportion, and that is through the method of resampling. We can take the data from Gallup's survery given the fact that we know the results he gathered, and we can perform many resamples (10000).

Lastly, if we want to see what factors impact margin of error (MOE) rather than just the sample size, we can plot it as a function of both sample size and sample proportion. We can do the same but while calculating the Wilson MOE, to see if we gain any additional insights.

\section{Methods}
The only data we are really working with here is Gallup's survey data from February 2025. We know that the sample size is 1004 adults living in all 50 states of the U.S, and that 39\% were satisfied with the position of the U.S. today, while 59\% were dissatisfied (2\% had no opinion). Gallup also reported that the margin of error was 4\%, but it's not clear how much he rounded that by.

So like I said before, we can approximate the sampling distribution for p without assuming the actual population proportion is 0.39. Instead, we can replicate Gallup's data by making a vector with 1004 data points, and making 39\% of the data a "1" (satisfied), and the rest of the data a "0" (dissatisfied or no opinion). This is technically not perfectly accurate because I am treating dissatisfied and no opinion equally, but when we are only studying the satisfied proportion, it is okay to treat them equally. With this data, we can perform resampling many times (10000), by using the \texttt{sample()} method from the base \texttt{R} package.

I also said that I want to test Gallup's statement about how the MOE changes when doubling the population from 1000 to 2000. We can do this by using the \texttt{rbinom()} function, and then using the \texttt{ggplot2} \citep{ggplot2} and \texttt{tidyverse} \citep{tidyverse} packages to plot the density of the sample proportions for both populations.

Lastly, in order to see MOE's relationship with both sample size (n) and proportion (p), we can again use \texttt{rbinom()} to simulate the data, and \texttt{quantile()} to calculate the range and eventually the MOE. Now that we have two independent variables, we can use \texttt{geom\textunderscore raster()}. This will make a plot that is easy to visualize the MOE's relationship with both variables.
\section{Results}
Below are the histograms of 10000 polls with sample size 1004, and then with sample size 2008 (doubled).

\end{Figure}

You can see that the plots are different, but they do both follow a relatively normal distribution. This is because the samples are random, and the sample sizes are well over 30. One thing you can't see from the graphs are the margins of error. After calculating them, I got an MOE of 0.03037845 (approx 3\%) for figure \ref{fig:histogram1}, and an MOE of 0.02141435 (approx 2\%) for figure \ref{fig:histogram2}. So although they line up pretty well for the 2008 sample size, the MOE was not halved. It's hard to know how different my MOE is from Gallup's for the original sample size because we don't know how much he rounded by, but there is definitely a difference.

\section{Discussion}
Maybe it is less worth the extra money to go from 3\% to 2\%
